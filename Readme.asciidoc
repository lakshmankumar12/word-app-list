Vocab Builder
=============

This is my first stab at angular JS, well, even javascript itself. The idea is
to build a word-list tester.

Word source
-----------

We gather about 5000+ words from [http://www.freevocabulary.com/]here. That
page itself is saved as +save_index_html+ in this repository.

Arranging the words in a script-friendly format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I used https://github.com/aaronsw/html2text[html2text] to grab just the text
and using vim, removed all other stuff expect the words themselves. This
filtered stuff is kept in +words_one_line+, also saved in this repository

Testing the goodness
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The +gobble_words.py+ script, in the repository is a command-line python script
to present the same questions.

The web page
------------

Updating words-list as a service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The words will be fetched one at a time on a need basis. This requires a API
service that can dish out the words. I picked [http://deployd.com/]deployd
for this purpose. The collecton itself is configured manually (I will soon
update the config.json for the collection).

The deployd's database (mongodb) is populated using its REST api - done via
the +update_deployd.py+ script.

The deployd's webserver itself is useful as serving for web-server for the
application as well.

The web-app
~~~~~~~~~~~

This is written with the angular-js library - +vocab_builder.html+ and
+controllers/vocab_builder.js+
